# Predicting-Air-Pollutant-Concentration-with-Multisensor-Data
Pollution is a great problem for public health and environment protection. In this project, we
aim to study the Air Quality dataset, where we try to find how pollution varies during the day, when
the peaks happen, and how pollutant concentrations are related to each other in order to predict these
pollutant concentrations. The data is collected from a gas multi-sensor device that is deployed in a
heavily polluted area of an Italian city. The dataset is collected from March 10th 2004 to February
10th 2005 (one year). We are given the hourly averaged responses of 12 arrays of gas multi-sensor
exposed to different gaseous mixtures and an hourly averaged reference value which represents the
ground truth. The data contains various pieces of information like, date and time attributes,
concentrations of various pollutants (CO, NMHC, C6H6, NOx, NO2, and the O3), and
meteorological attributes, like, temperature, relative humidity and absolute humidity. The target is to
estimate the gas concentration for a particular pollutant using various Machine Learning models.
